Loan Eligibility Prediction
This project aims to develop a Loan Eligibility Prediction model using Python, focusing on predicting loan approval status (Approved/Not Approved). The dataset is explored to understand its structure, features, and target variable, providing insights into the factors influencing loan eligibility.

Key Features:
Data Exploration: In-depth analysis of the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementation of popular ML algorithms to build and evaluate the prediction model.
Python Libraries: Utilization of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
This hands-on project enhances your understanding of Data Science concepts while providing practical experience in building a predictive model.
